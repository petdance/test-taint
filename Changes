        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        tainted() now localizes $SIG{__DIE__} before performing the
        taint check.  If the calling program has its own $SIG{__DIE__},
        we don't want to use it.  Thanks, Pete Krawczyk.

        [FIXES]
        Checks for undef before opening files when trying to create
        some taint. Thanks Frédéric Buclin.

1.04    Mon Aug  9 22:06:10 CDT 2004
        No differences from 1.03_01.

        More goodness from Dan Kubb.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        New functions:
        * tainted_ok_deeply()
        * untainted_ok_deeply()

        [INTERNALS]
        * Added Build.PL for those who prefer Module::Build.

        * Added tests to improve coverage.  It's at 99% coverage now,
          up from around 80%.

        * Refactored the traversal code so that tainted_deeply and
          taint_deeply share almost the exact same code to walk the data
          structure.


1.02    April 22nd, 2004
        This is the "Thanks, Dan Kubb" release.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added taint_deeply() to taint all elements in a structure.


1.00    March 14th, 2004
        This is the "Thanks, Dave Rolsky" release.

        [FIXES]
        * taint() could corrupt a string and set it to 0.
        * Removed requirement on Test::Builder::Tester.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * The taint() function now goes thru XS, instead of Perl magic.
